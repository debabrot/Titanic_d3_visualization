### Summary

- The bar chart contains the survival rate of passengers grouped by their agegroup, gender and class.
- Survival rate is defined as ( Number of survivors / Number of Passengers * 100 ). 
- By looking at survival rate you can can find which class had the most chances of survival.
- It can be seen that the survival rate of first class and women is higher than the rest.

### Design

- I have used a barchart to show the survival rate. Barchart is useful when comparing groups of data
- I have used a form to allow the user to get the survival rate by class and gender
